<h3>Steps Taken to Complete the Game</h3>
    <li>Drew up a couple different wireframes to prep for my page design.</li>
    <li>Wireframes include main page as well as a login pop up box. My final project unfortunately did not look exactly like my wireframe as I did not include pop up boxes for logging in and signing up, but my main design did come out nicely and resembled my orginal wireframe design.</li>
    <li>Created a user stories to help me decide most important page needs and functions. User stories can be seen below.</li>
    <li>Set up a personal workflow schedule with deadlines in which I wanted to hit. Also made a personal requriements checklist to help keep me organized.</li>
    <li>Started my project by first attacking the game API since it was so fresh in my head. I created fields for users to signup, signin, signout and change password. I then tested these with the API created to make sure all the information was logging.</li>
    <li> After creating the API I built a bare bones title and gameboard in which would hold my X's and O's</li>
    <li>Created a "Start New Game" button in which the user could clear the board and start a new game</li>
    <li>Began creating game logic. Made sure 2 players could play my game and have it display X's and O's on the board. I was able to get the game logic to display the winner of each game, but struggled with how to find a tie game. It took me some time, but I figured it out!</li>
    <li>Throughout the process I made several Commits to save my place and keep organized. I also deployed my game online everyday.</li>
    <li>Creating this game has been a great experience and although I did build a working game there are still a couple additional requirement that I need to complete.</li>
